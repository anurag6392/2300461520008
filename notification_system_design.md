# Stage 1 – Notification REST API Design

This document defines the REST APIs and real-time mechanism for a campus notification platform that delivers updates about Placements, Events, and Results to logged-in students.

## Core Actions

- Create a notification (by an admin or system process).
- Fetch notifications for a user (with pagination and filters).
- Fetch unread notifications for a user.
- Mark a notification as read.
- Mark all notifications as read.
- Delete a notification for a user.
- Subscribe to real-time notification updates.

## REST API Endpoints

Assumption: Users accessing the APIs are already authenticated by the platform, and the backend derives the current user from context or headers.

| Action                          | Method | Endpoint                             | Description                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Create notification             | POST   | /notifications                       | Create a new notification                        |
| Get notifications (paginated)   | GET    | /notifications                       | List notifications for the current user          |
| Get unread notifications        | GET    | /notifications/unread                | List unread notifications for the current user   |
| Mark notification as read       | PATCH  | /notifications/{notificationId}/read | Mark a single notification as read               |
| Mark all as read                | PATCH  | /notifications/read-all              | Mark all notifications as read for the user      |
| Delete notification             | DELETE | /notifications/{notificationId}      | Delete (hide) a single notification for the user |
| Real-time stream (SSE/WebSocket)| GET    | /notifications/stream                | Subscribe to real-time notification updates      |

## Common Headers

All APIs assume that the user is pre-authorised by the platform.

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Accept: application/json`
- `X-Request-Id` (optional, for tracing and logging)
- `X-User-Id` (optional; used if the backend does not derive user from token)

## Real-Time Notification Mechanism

For real-time updates, the platform can use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to push notifications from the server to the browser over a long-lived HTTP connection. Alternatively, a WebSocket endpoint can be used with the same payload structure.

### GET /notifications/stream (SSE)

**Behavior**

- The frontend opens a persistent connection to `/notifications/stream`.
- When a new notification relevant to the user is created, the backend pushes an SSE event.
- The client updates the UI (badge counts, notification list) immediately.

**Request**

- Method: `GET`
- Headers:
  - `Accept: text/event-stream`
  - `X-User-Id`: current user

**Example SSE event**

```text
event: notification
data: {
  "id": "notif_12345",
  "title": "Drive: ABC Corp",
  "message": "ABC Corp is visiting on 20th June. Register before 18th June.",
  "type": "PLACEMENT",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "UNREAD",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-11T08:00:00Z"
}
```

If WebSockets are preferred, the client connects to a `/notifications/ws` endpoint and receives JSON messages with the same fields.

# Stage 2 – Persistent Storage Design

This section defines the database choice, schema, scaling concerns, and example queries for implementing the notification APIs defined in Stage 1.

## Choice of Database

I recommend using a relational database such as **PostgreSQL** for the notification system.

Reasons:

- Notifications are inherently relational: they are associated with users, types, and potential delivery logs.
- We need efficient filtering and pagination by user, status, type, and time, which relational databases handle well.
- Strong consistency is preferred so that unread/read state is reliable for each user.

## Database Schema

A simple relational schema with three core tables works well: `users`, `notifications`, and `notification_recipients`.

### Table: users

Stores basic user information relevant for targeting.

- `id` (PK, UUID)
- `name` (text)
- `email` (text, unique)
- `department` (text)
- `batch` (integer)

### Table: notifications

Stores the content and metadata of each notification.

- `id` (PK, UUID)
- `title` (text)
- `message` (text)
- `type` (text) – e.g., `PLACEMENT`, `EVENT`, `RESULT`
- `priority` (text) – e.g., `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`
- `created_by` (UUID, FK to users.id, nullable for system-generated)
- `scheduled_at` (timestamptz, nullable)
- `created_at` (timestamptz, default `NOW()`)
- `meta` (jsonb, optional)
- Index on (`type`, `priority`, `created_at`)

### Table: notification_recipients

Stores which user receives which notification and the user-specific state.

- `id` (PK, UUID)
- `notification_id` (UUID, FK to notifications.id)
- `user_id` (UUID, FK to users.id)
- `status` (text) – `UNREAD`, `READ`, `DELETED`
- `read_at` (timestamptz, nullable)
- `created_at` (timestamptz, default `NOW()`)
- Index on (`user_id`, `status`, `created_at`)
- Index on (`notification_id`)

This schema supports all the Stage 1 APIs (creation, listing, read/unread, deletion) while remaining flexible for future features like archiving or delivery logs.

## Scaling Challenges

As data volume grows, several problems can arise:

- **Large notification history**  
  - The `notification_recipients` table can grow to millions of rows as notifications are sent to many users.  
  - Queries like `GET /notifications` and `GET /notifications/unread` may slow down without proper indexing.

- **High write volume**  
  - Creating notifications and marking them as read are frequent write operations.  
  - Hot indexes (on `user_id` and `status`) can become bottlenecks.

- **Storage bloat**  
  - Old notifications (e.g., older than a year) may no longer be relevant but still consume storage and degrade performance.

## Approaches to Solve Scaling Problems

- **Index optimization**
  - Maintain composite indexes on (`user_id`, `status`, `created_at`) to speed up unread and recent queries.
  - Periodically monitor index usage and rebuild or drop unused indexes.

- **Pagination and sensible limits**
  - Enforce pagination in APIs with a reasonable maximum `pageSize`.
  - Encourage clients to load only recent notifications by default and lazy-load older ones.

- **Archival strategy**
  - Move old notifications (e.g., older than 12 months) from main tables to archive tables or cold storage.
  - Keep only recent notifications in the primary `notifications` and `notification_recipients` tables.

- **Table partitioning**
  - Partition `notification_recipients` by `created_at` (monthly/yearly) or by user ranges in very large deployments.
  - This keeps indexes smaller and improves query performance for recent data.

- **Caching**
  - Cache unread counts per user in a fast store such as Redis.
  - Update the cache when notifications are created or marked as read, reducing DB load on every poll.

## Example SQL Queries

The following SQL queries correspond to the REST APIs defined in Stage 1.

### 1. Create notification and assign recipients

Insert a new notification:

```sql
INSERT INTO notifications (
  id,
  title,
  message,
  type,
  priority,
  created_by,
  scheduled_at,
  meta,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  :notification_id,
  :title,
  :message,
  :type,
  :priority,
  :created_by,
  :scheduled_at,
  :meta::jsonb,
  NOW()
);
```

Assign the notification to a recipient (example for one user; in practice this can be a bulk insert):

```sql
INSERT INTO notification_recipients (
  id,
  notification_id,
  user_id,
  status,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  :recipient_id,
  :notification_id,
  :user_id,
  'UNREAD',
  NOW()
);
```

### 2. Get notifications for current user (paginated)

```sql
SELECT
  nr.id AS recipient_row_id,
  n.id AS notification_id,
  n.title,
  n.message,
  n.type,
  n.priority,
  nr.status,
  nr.created_at,
  nr.read_at,
  n.meta
FROM notification_recipients nr
JOIN notifications n ON n.id = nr.notification_id
WHERE nr.user_id = :user_id
  AND (:type IS NULL OR n.type = :type)
  AND (:status IS NULL OR nr.status = :status)
ORDER BY nr.created_at DESC
LIMIT :page_size OFFSET (:page - 1) * :page_size;
```

### 3. Get unread notifications for current user

```sql
SELECT
  nr.id AS recipient_row_id,
  n.id AS notification_id,
  n.title,
  n.message,
  n.type,
  n.priority,
  nr.status,
  nr.created_at,
  n.meta
FROM notification_recipients nr
JOIN notifications n ON n.id = nr.notification_id
WHERE nr.user_id = :user_id
  AND nr.status = 'UNREAD'
ORDER BY nr.created_at DESC;
```

### 4. Mark a single notification as read

```sql
UPDATE notification_recipients
SET status = 'READ',
    read_at = NOW()
WHERE notification_id = :notification_id
  AND user_id = :user_id
  AND status <> 'DELETED';
```

### 5. Mark all notifications as read for a user

```sql
UPDATE notification_recipients
SET status = 'READ',
    read_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = :user_id
  AND status = 'UNREAD';
```

### 6. Delete a notification for a user (soft delete)

```sql
UPDATE notification_recipients
SET status = 'DELETED'
WHERE notification_id = :notification_id
  AND user_id = :user_id;
```

These queries, combined with the schema and API design above, provide a complete end-to-end design for the notification platform required in Stage 1 and Stage 2.

# Stage 3 – Query Optimization and Indexing

An earlier developer in the team chose a relational database for storage (MySQL or PostgreSQL or any other SQL database) about 3 months ago. The database has grown to 50,000 students and 5,000,000 notifications. The developer had written the query below, which is now performing slowly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM notifications
WHERE studentID = 1042 AND isRead = false
ORDER BY createdAt ASC;
```

## Is this query accurate?

Yes, the query is **logically accurate** for fetching unread notifications of a specific student. It correctly filters by `studentID` and `isRead = false`, and orders by recency.

## Why is this slow?

Reasons:

1. **`SELECT *`** fetches all columns, increasing I/O and memory usage, especially when the table has many columns.
2. **No suitable index** on `(studentID, isRead, createdAt)` forces a large scan over many rows.
3. With 50,000 students and 5,000,000 notifications, this becomes a full table scan or large range scan.
4. **`ORDER BY createdAt`** without an index on `createdAt` forces an extra sort step after filtering.
5. No `LIMIT` is used, so the query may return all unread notifications for that student, which can be large.

## What would you change?

Improved query:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  studentID,
  isRead,
  createdAt,
  notificationType,
  title,
  message
FROM notifications
WHERE studentID = 1042
  AND isRead = false
ORDER BY createdAt ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

Changes:

- Select only needed columns instead of `SELECT *`.
- Add `LIMIT 100` to avoid fetching all rows on every request; the backend will paginate.
- This reduces I/O and memory usage.

## Indexing strategy

Instead of adding indexes on every column:

- Add a **composite index**:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_student_unread_created
    ON notifications (studentID, isRead, createdAt);
  ```

This allows:

- Fast filtering by `studentID` and `isRead`.
- Direct ordering by `createdAt` without extra sort overhead.

Adding indexes on every column:

- Increases write cost (indexes must be updated on every INSERT/UPDATE).
- Uses more disk space.
- Can degrade performance for write-heavy operations.
- Not effective if the query pattern is not aligned with the index.

So, the advice to add indexes on every column is **not effective**.

## Query: students with placement notification in last 7 days

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT studentID
FROM notifications
WHERE notificationType = 'Placement'
  AND createdAt >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

Or in MySQL:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT studentID
FROM notifications
WHERE notificationType = 'Placement'
  AND createdAt >= NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;
```

This query uses the `notificationType` column and `createdAt` for filtering, and will benefit from the composite index defined above if extended to include `notificationType`.

# Stage 4 – Performance Caching and Strategies

Problem:  
Notifications are being fetched on each page load for every student. The DB is getting overwhelmed, causing bad user experience.

## Suggested solutions

### 1. Use caching (Redis) for unread counts and recent notifications

**Approach:**

- Cache:
  - Unread notification count per student.
  - Recent notifications (e.g., last 20–50) for each student.
- On each page load:
  - First, check cache.
  - If cache has data, return it.
  - If cache misses, fetch from DB and update cache.

**Tradeoffs:**

- **Pros:**
  - Reduces DB load significantly.
  - Faster response times for repeated page loads.
  - Can handle high traffic with many students.
- **Cons:**
  - Need to manage cache invalidation when notifications are created or read.
  - Adds complexity (cache layer, TTL, consistency).
  - Requires extra infrastructure (Redis).

**Implementation sketch:**

- Cache key: `unread_count:{studentID}`
- Cache key: `notifications:{studentID}:{page}:{pageSize}`
- TTL: e.g., 5–10 minutes, or invalidate on write (create/mark read/delete).

### 2. Database optimization and pagination

**Approach:**

- Use the composite index from Stage 3.
- Enforce pagination with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.
- Avoid `SELECT *`.

**Tradeoffs:**

- **Pros:**
  - Reduces DB scan cost.
  - Works even without extra infrastructure.
- **Cons:**
  - Still requires DB queries for each request.
  - Not sufficient alone for very high traffic.

### 3. Asynchronous background jobs for heavy operations

**Approach:**

- Use background workers (e.g., Node.js workers, Python Celery, etc.) to:
  - Precompute unread counts.
  - Pre-fetch and cache recent notifications.
  - Handle bulk operations (e.g., `notify_all`).

**Tradeoffs:**

- **Pros:**
  - Reduces main request latency.
  - Better for bulk notifications.
- **Cons:**
  - Adds complexity (message queues, job management).
  - Need to handle failures and retries.

### Recommended strategy

Use a combination:

- Add the composite index (Stage 3).
- Cache unread counts and recent notifications with Redis.
- Use background workers for heavy operations like `notify_all`.

This gives the best balance of performance and scalability.

# Stage 5 – Reliable and Fast `notify_all` Pseudocode

Original pseudocode:

```python
function notify_all(student_ids: array, message: string):
    for student_id in student_ids:
        send_email(student_id, message)  # calls Email API
        save_to_db(student_id, message)  # DB insert
        push_to_app(student_id, message) # real-time notification
```

## Shortcomings of this implementation

1. **No error handling**:
   - If `send_email` fails for some students, the loop continues but we don’t know or retry.
2. **No logging**:
   - No logs to track which students succeeded or failed.
3. **No retries**:
   - If email fails mid-way for 200 students, those students never get the email.
4. **Sequential processing**:
   - For 50,000 students, this is very slow.
5. **No separation of concerns**:
   - DB insert and email send are in the same loop; if one fails, we don’t know what to do.
6. **Not scalable**:
   - Not suitable for large batch notifications in real time.

## What if `send_email` fails for 200 students midway?

- Those 200 students don’t get the email.
- We have no record of failure.
- We don’t retry.

## Redesign for reliability and speed

### Key ideas

- **Use a job queue** for email sending and in-app notifications.
- **Separate DB insert from email send**:
  - Save to DB first, so we have a record.
  - Then enqueue email and in-app tasks.
- **Use retries with logging** for email and in-app notifications.
- **Process in batches**, not one-by-one.
- **Use logging middleware** to track success/failure.

## Revised pseudocode

```python
function notify_all(student_ids: array, message: string):
    # Step 1: Save all notifications to DB first
    for batch in batch(student_ids, size=1000):
        for student_id in batch:
            # Use logging middleware
            logger.info("Creating notification for student", student_id=student_id)

            save_to_db(
                student_id=student_id,
                message=message,
                notification_type="PLACEMENT",
                status="UNREAD"
            )

            # Enqueue email and in-app tasks
            enqueue_email_task(student_id=student_id, message=message)
            enqueue_inapp_task(student_id=student_id, message=message)

    # Step 2: Background workers will process email and in-app tasks
    # with retries and logging

function enqueue_email_task(student_id: string, message: string):
    logger.info("Enqueueing email task", student_id=student_id)
    job_queue.enqueue(
        job="send_email",
        args={
            "student_id": student_id,
            "message": message
        }
        retry_count=3,
        on_failure=lambda: logger.error("Email send failed", student_id=student_id)
    )

function enqueue_inapp_task(student_id: string, message: string):
    logger.info("Enqueueing in-app task", student_id=student_id)
    job_queue.enqueue(
        job="push_to_app",
        args={
            "student_id": student_id,
            "message": message
        }
        retry_count=3,
        on_failure=lambda: logger.error("In-app push failed", student_id=student_id)
    )
```

### Should DB save and email send happen together?

- **No**, they should not happen together in the same synchronous call.
- **Reasons:**
  - Email sending is external and can fail; DB save should be reliable.
  - Separating them allows:
    - DB to be updated first, so we have a record.
    - Email to be sent asynchronously via a queue with retries.
  - This improves reliability and speed.

# Stage 6 – Priority Inbox (Top 10 Notifications)

Goal:  
Implement a Priority Inbox that always displays the top `n` most important unread notifications first (e.g., top 10).  
Priority is determined by:

- **Weight**: `placement > result > event`
- **Recency**: newer notifications are more important

You must:

- Use the provided Notification API:
  `GET http://4.224.186.213/evaluation-service/notifications`
- Find the top 10 unread notifications.
- Use your **logging middleware** extensively.
- Write real code (not pseudocode).
- Push code and screenshots to the same GitHub repo.
- Explain your approach in this section.

## Approach

1. Fetch all notifications from the API.
2. Filter only unread notifications.
3. Assign a numeric priority score to each notification:
   - Base weight:
     - `placement`: 3
     - `result`: 2
     - `event`: 1
   - Recency factor: use `createdAt` (e.g., timestamp) to boost newer notifications.
4. Sort by score descending.
5. Return top 10.

### Example score formula

```python
priority_score = type_weight * (1 + recency_factor)
```

Where:

- `type_weight` = 3 for `Placement`, 2 for `Result`, 1 for `Event`
- `recency_factor` = some value based on `createdAt` (e.g., `timestamp / max_timestamp`)

Alternatively, you can:

- Sort first by type weight (placement, result, event), then by `createdAt` descending.

## Python implementation example

```python
import requests
from typing import List, Dict

import logging
from logging_utils import get_logger  # your logging middleware wrapper

logger = get_logger("priority_inbox")

def get_type_weight(notification_type: str) -> int:
    """
    Assign weight based on notification type.
    placement > result > event
    """
    type_map = {
        "Placement": 3,
        "Result": 2,
        "Event": 1,
    }
    return type_map.get(notification_type, 0)

def fetch_notifications(api_url: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Fetch notifications from the API.
    Uses logging middleware for request logging.
    """
    logger.info("Fetching notifications from API", url=api_url)
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        logger.error("API request failed", status_code=response.status_code, url=api_url)
        raise RuntimeError(f"API request failed with status {response.status_code}")

    logger.info("Successfully fetched notifications", count=len(response.json()))
    return response.json()

def compute_priority_score(notification: Dict) -> float:
    """
    Compute priority score based on type weight and recency.
    """
    type_weight = get_type_weight(notification.get("notificationType", ""))

## Maintaining top 10 efficiently as new notifications come in

Options:

1. **Recompute on each request**:
   - Fetch all, filter unread, compute score, sort, and take top 10.
   - Simple, but may be slow if there are many notifications.

2. **Cache top 10**:
   - Cache the top 10 unread notifications in Redis.
   - Invalidate or update cache when:
     - A new notification is created.
     - A notification is marked as read/deleted.
   - This is more efficient for high read volume.

3. **Use a sorted data structure**:
   - Use a sorted set (e.g., Redis Sorted Set) keyed by priority score.
   - Insert new notifications with their score.
   - Query top N in O(log N).

For this assignment, recomputing on each request is acceptable, but you can mention caching as an optimization.

## Files to push

- `priority_inbox.py` (or `.js`, `.ts`, etc.) – your code file.
- Screenshots showing the top 10 priority notifications printed/displayed.

Update your `notification_system_design.md` with this section (already added above), then push:

```bash
git add notification_system_design.md priority_inbox.py
git commit -m "feat: add Stage 6 Priority Inbox code and explanation"
git push origin main
```

Then take screenshots of the output and push them too.
